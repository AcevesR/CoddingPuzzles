Considering three numbers A, B, and C (all of them integers), determine their sum.

Explanation:

In the third sample, A + B + C = 16 + 6 + 97 = 119.

Sample 1:
  A = 3
  B = 2
  C = 1
  
  Result = 6
  
Sample 2:
  A = 100
  B = 200
  C = 300
  
  Result = 600
  
 Sample 3:
  A = 16
  B = 6
  C = 97
  
  Result = 119
